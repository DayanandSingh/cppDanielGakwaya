C++ has been one of the most popular programming languages for over 30 years. Developers use it for everything from building video games to coding operating systems.

We just published a comprehensive 31-hour C++ course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

Daniel Gakwaya developed this course. Daniel is an experienced software engineer and course creator.

This course will give you a comprehensive introduction to modern C++ with C++20. You will go from being a beginner to an advanced user.

Here are all the topics covered in this course:
