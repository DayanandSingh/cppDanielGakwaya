>* Booleans occupy 8 bit of Memory Or 1 Byte.
>* A byte can store 256 different values.
>* Using it just to cover two states (True/False) is wasteful, especially for device with hard memory constraints (think embedded devices).
>* There are techniques to pack even more data into a byte. we'll learn more about these in a few upcomming chapters.
